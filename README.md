How To Use:
1. Spawn a portal gun in the spawn menu.
2. Left/Right-click to shoot portals.
3. Reload to remove all portals.
4. If your portals don't look right on the other side, you need to enable r_novis. To do this, you need to turn sv_cheats to 1, then turn r_novis to 1. This is done through the console. Google it.
