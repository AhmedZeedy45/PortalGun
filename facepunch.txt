[B][U]Description:[/U][/B]
A fully functional Portal Gun. This is by far the most eloquent and bug-free portal gun available within Garry's Mod. 
Left click to shoot a blue portal. Right click to shoot an orange portal. Reload to remove all portals. Press E to pick up an item. 
[B][I]TO MAKE THE PORTALS WORK RIGHT, RUN "r_novis 1" IN CONSOLE.[/I][/B]

[B][U]Features:[/U][/B]
• Portals which look exactly like the portals in Portal 1, with seamless rendering
• Walk through portals just like the game. No more sucking or poofing!
• Standalone, does not require Portal or Portal 2 to work correctly. 
• Velocity is (almost) entirely preserved as you enter the portal. 
• Optional dynamic lights 
• Shoot through portals
• Take props through portals
• Several convars to adjust the portal gun to your liking (listed below).
